## Applied Interface Design Principles
* 11 Strong visual hierarchies work best
* 10 Consistency matters
* 6 One primary action per screen

## User Scenario
I want to discover new music and listen to it when I'm on the metro on my way to college.

## Strong visual hierarchies work best
The layout does have a strong h1 in everypage so everyone knows the
primary action on te screen.

## Consistency matters
On the first page the layout is perfect consistant and is simple to understand.

## One Primary Action per Screen
* The first screen is an overview
* The seccond screen is the new music that you can listen to.
* The third screen is made to find more music that is related.

## Adjustments after feedback
